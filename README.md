# A comparison of Panic! at the Disco's discography through the years

###### (Please do not show this portfolio in class)

Recently, the band Panic! at the Disco announced that they will no longer be making music, after nearly 20 years of being in the industry. Over those years, the band has released seven albums. Not only is it interesting that these seven albums were created over the course of many years, but the band composition differed between some albums as well. Where the first album was created by the original band, nearly every following album has at least one new band member replacing an old member, with the last three albums being produced with solely the lead singer left as member of the band. 

It would be interesting to see what the differences and similarities are between all of these albums, and additionally study whether there are similarities and differences between albums produced by the same band composition. 

Some differences between the albums can be noted after a few listens: *A Fever You Can't Sweat Out* (2005) is upbeat, and has different sounds and instruments within the album, and has been described as emo and alternative rock. *Pretty. Odd.* (2008) is slower and less loud, and has been described as classic rock and folk rock. *Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die* (2013), as a final example, seems to have more dance tracks with an electronic sound. The albums must have features in common too, as they are released under the same band name, have the same singer and overlapping song writers. I can't put my finger on it (yet) what makes these albums similar and typically Panic! at the Disco. 

All albums and officially released songs can be found on spotify, except for some bonus tracks. These and singles (produced for e.g. movies) will be excluded for convenience. 
For each album specifically, I want to compare the most popular song. Perhaps these songs are more similar to each other than the complete albums, because they have something in common that appeals to listeners. Or, on the other hand, perhaps they represent the album best and are thereby quite different from each other.
